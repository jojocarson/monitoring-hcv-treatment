        <h3 class="archive__subtitle">Prescribers</h3>
        <p>Prescribing of DAA therapy by Primary Care Clinicians (general Practitioners and nurse practitioners) has increased over time, 
            while prescribing by HCV specialists (gastroenterologists and infectious disease physicians) has declined. In 2023, 
            Primary Care Clinicians prescribed 66% of treatment and 73% of retreatments.</p>  
        <h3 class="archive__subtitle">Treatment</h3>
        <p> The most common prescribers of HCV treatment in Australia were General Practitioners (46%). The proportion of people
            treated by people treated by general practitioners increased from 31% in 2016 to 55% in 2023. During this period 
            prescribing by gastroenterologists declined from 50% to 19%. Prescribing by Nurse Practitioners has increased during
             the past five years, rising from 2% in 2019 to 11% in 2023. Prescriber trends for treatment are illustrated in 
             <strong>Figure 9A.</strong></p>

        </div>
        <h3 class="archive__subtitle">Retreatment for treatment failure</h3>
        <p>Most people retreated for treatment failure were retreated by HCV specialists (51%). During the past five years, 
            however, prescribing of retreatment for treatment failure by Primary Care Clinicians increased <strong>(Figure 9B).</strong> 
            In 2023, 46% of retreatments for treatment failure were prescribed by General practitioners and 12% were 
            prescribed by Nurse Practitioners.

        <h3 class="archive__subtitle">Retreatment for reinfection</h3>
        <p>Most people retreated for reinfection were retreated by Primary Care Clinicians (72%). During the past five years, 
            prescribing of retreatments for reinfection by Nurse Practitioners increased <strong>(Figure 9C).</strong> 
            In 2023, 56% of retreatments for reinfection were prescribed by General Practitioners and 21% were prescribed 
            by Nurse Practitioners.
