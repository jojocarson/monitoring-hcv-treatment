          <h3 class="archive__subtitle">Age</h3>
          <p>The median age of individuals initiating HCV treatment during 2016 to 2023 was 48 years. Median age declined from 52 years 
              in 2016 to 44 years in 2023. DAA treatment uptake by age group is illustrated in <strong>Figure 5.</strong>  
              An increasing trend of younger people initiating treatment was observed, with the largest increases among people
              â‰¤30 years.

          </div>
          <p>Age distribution among individuals retreated for treatment failure was consistent with that observed for treatment.
            Median age was 47 years; declining from 56 in 2016 to 44 years in 2023. A younger age distribution was observed among
            individuals retreated for reinfection. Median age was 36 years; declining from 45 in 2016 to 36 years in 2023. </p>

          <h3 class="archive__subtitle">Gender</h3>
          <p> Of individuals initiating HCV treatment between 2016 and 2023, 69% (n=72870) were men and 31% (n=33077) women. 
              During this period the proportion of women initiating treatment declined from 34% to 26%. Age distribution for 
              treatment or retreatment was consistent between genders.

          <h3 class="archive__subtitle">Treatment discontinuation</h3>
          <p>Despite increased prescribing of shorter duration pangenotypic DAA therapy <strong>(Figures 6A and 6B)</strong> 
              treatment discontinuation continued to rise. Treatment discontinuation, defined as missing at least 4 weeks of 
              treatment, was higher among women compared to men. In 2023, treatment discontinuation rates were 17% among women
              compared to 10% among men.  The trends in treatment discontinuation for men and women are illustrated in 
              <strong>Figure 7.</strong></p>

          <h3 class="archive__subtitle">Retreatment</h3>
          <p>Retreatment trends
              Patterns of retreatment differed by gender. Among men an increasing trend in retreatment for reinfection was observed 
              <strong>(Figures 8A and 8B).</strong> An increasing trend in retreatment for treatment failure was observed among women, 
              consistent with the rising treatment discontinuation rate.
