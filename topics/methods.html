            <h2 class="archive__title">Methodology</h2>
            <h3 class="archive__subtitle">Treatment</h3>
            <p>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) data of all DAA prescriptions dispensed in Australia between March 2016 and 
                December 2023 in Australia were used in the analysis. The first DAA prescription was considered initial treatment. 
                Prescriber type was defined based on the prescriber derived major speciality codes recorded by PBS. 
                In this coding system, medical trainees (i.e., registrars) are considered as specialists. Jurisdictions are 
                based on the patient residence at the time of treatment or retreatment prescription. More details of methodology 
                were described previously<sup>1</sup>.</p>
            <h3 class="archive__subtitle">Treatment discontinuation</h3>
            <p> DAA treatment is typically dispensed in 28-day supplies. Treatment discontinuation was defined as one or more repeat 
                prescription (28-days or more) of the authorised duration not dispensed. Individuals who discontinued initial treatment
                and restarted a different regimen ≤28 days before the estimated end of treatment date (calculated as date of dispensation
                plus the number of daily doses dispensed) were considered treatment switches or lost prescriptions and were not 
                considered treatment discontinuations. Where the first DAA prescribed was discontinued and the second DAA prescribed
                was initiated within 28 days, this was considered the same treatment to account for extended durations of therapy. 
                Individuals commencing treatment in the last quarter of 2023 were given at least three months of follow up following
                initial dispensation to fill prescription repeats ensure sufficient time for completion of treatment. Individuals 
                who were dispensed the whole treatment course at a single time were also excluded from this analysis. More details 
                of methodology were described previously<sup>2</sup>.</p>
            <h3 class="archive__subtitle">Retreatment</h3>
            <p>Retreatment was defined as commencement of a different DAA prescription any time after estimated end of treatment date 
                (unless initial regimen was discontinued). Reason for retreatment (treatment failure or reinfection) is not captured 
                in PBS data. A supervised machine learning model (random forest architecture; sensitivity 96%, specificity 97%) was
                developed using real-world standard-of-care data from the REACH-C study (10843 treated; 350 retreated with reason 
                available)<sup>3,4</sup>. The model was applied to pharmaceutical benefits scheme data to assess trends in retreatment for 
                reinfection and treatment failure. Details of the machine learning algorithm, model training procedure, and model 
                performance metrics were described previously<sup>5</sup>.</p>
